# Project 4

### Overview

**The time has come for your final project.**

This is your capstone project, and as such is left the most open to you to decide which technologies are most suitable.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll showcase your skills both visually and functionally**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

If you want to deviate beyond the technologies and materials covered in the course, you must check in with your instructor first!

You are allowed to form teams. But do note that the scope of your project is expected to be larger (i.e. more (complex) features, cleaner, more efficient code.)

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Be a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- **Be a complete product**, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
- **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- **Implement full CRUD** the app has to be able to create, read, update and delete data from the database

Your app should:

- **Use a database** or a way to store your data, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
- **Have an interactive front-end**

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A `README.md` file** with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
- A presentation with slides of 15 minutes or less demoing your app

### Optional Deliverables

- A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo

### Presentation

Presentation day will consist of a short slide deck introducing the problem space of the project and how the app solves a problem for a user. Each person/team will have up to 15 minutes to present and demo their work with Q & A.

## Work Strategies

### Motivations

One choice you must make in choosing _which_ project to make is your goal and motivation for choosing it, and if you can accomplish that goal within the given time.

Some possible reasons for choosing a given project idea:

- this project will help me understand CSS better
- this project will be an important part of my portfolio
- this project will challenge me to use React and AJAX
- this project will help me understand HTTP
- this project will help me review and shore up my React skills

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
- **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
- **Be consistent with your code style.**
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
